You may be the property owner or a relative of the owner who has passed away — we can help in either situation. It’s important to know we’ll never ask you for any money. If the property qualifies for one of the programs, a team member will collect details needed to ensure the auction is cancelled.\n\nIf you are the owner — great news — there’s a state program that may let you save your property and keep it. Not all properties qualify, so a short conversation can determine eligibility.\n\nIf the owner has passed and you’re a close family member — you may be entitled to proceeds. You must act fast before the property is lost.\n\nOk, since this is a timing emergency, let's get you on the schedule for a short call as soon as possible.

There is a way for you to keep your property at 580 South Sapodilla Avenue 102 in West Palm Beach and stop the auction that is scheduled. There is a Nationwide program that allows you to save your property and keep it. Not all properties qualify, so a short conversation can determine if you can take advantage of this program. If this is Vicki L Bagley or you are a close relative, would you like to find out if your property qualifies for help?\nUser: Yeah.\nAgent: OK. It’s important for you to know that we will NEVER ask you for any money. The details surrounding the situation are not my business but that's what Brett or Chris or one of the other team members will be able to help with. Also, if the owner has passed away but you are a close family member - you may be entitled to a part of the proceeds so you must act fast before the property is lost.\n\nSince this is urgent, the next step is to book an appointment with one of the other team members. They are our foreclosure specialists in your area. They will go over the details and explain the process and see if the property qualifies for one of our programs. We’ve helped thousands of customers in similar situations over the past 15 years. Ok, since this is a timing emergency, let's get you on the schedule for a short call as soon as possible. Would you like to book an appointment?\nUser: Yes.\nAgent: Let me \nAgent: check our appointment availability.Uhh... I have two options: Today at 7:00 PM EST or tomorrow (Jan 22) at 11:40 AM EST.

NOT calling about buying it. I am sure you are getting lots of those calls already. I am calling to let you in on a little secret... There is a way for you to keep your property at 14743 1St Avenue East in Bradenton and stop the auction that is scheduled. There is a Nationwide program that allows you to save your property and keep it. Not all properties qualify, so a short conversation can determine if you can take advantage of this program. If this is Tiffany Lashawn Washington or you are a close relative, would you like to find out if your property qualifies for help?\nUser: Yes.\nAgent: OK. It’s important for you to know that we will NEVER ask you for any money. The details surrounding the situation are not my business but that's what Brett or Chris or one of the other team members will be able to help with. Also, if the owner has passed away but you are a close family member - you may be entitled to a part of the proceeds so you must act fast before the property is lost.Since this is urgent, the next step is to book an appointment with one of the other team members. They are our foreclosure specialists in your area. They will go over the details and explain the process and see if the property qualifies for one of our programs. We’ve helped thousands of customers in similar situations over the past 15 years. Ok, since this is a timing emergency, let's get you on the schedule for a short call as soon as possible. Would you like to book an appointment?\nUser: Yeah.\nAgent: Let me check our \nAgent: appointment availability.Uhh… I mean — I can book that. Two available options: Today at 6:40 PM EST or Tomorrow (Jan 22) at 11:00 AM EST. Which works?\nUser: Do you have anything right now?\nAgent: Uhh... Today at 6:40 PM EST is the soonest available. Want me to book it?\nUser: What about right now?\nAgent: Uhh... I mean, we don't have any immediate \"right now\" slots — the soonest is Today at 6:40 PM EST. Do you want me to book that?\nUser: I don't know.\nAgent: Uhh... no problem. Would you prefer later today at 6:40 PM EST or tomorrow morning at 11:00 AM EST?\nUser: How about now?\nAgent: That's a really great question. Chris will answer this on the call.Uhh... Would you prefer Today at 6:40 PM EST or Tomorrow at 11:00 AM EST?\nUser: Good day.\nAgent: Uhh... Good day. Would you like to book Today at 6:40 PM EST or Tomorrow at 11:00 AM EST?\nUser: Today.\nAgent: Booking appointment \nAgent: for Today at 6:40 PM EST.Ok great. Your appointment is successfully booked. Any questions?\nUser: Thank you\nAgent: Uhh... You’re welcome. Anything else before I go?\nUser: So they're gonna call me at six forty?\nAgent: Uhh... Yes — they’ll call you Today at 6:40 PM EST. Anything else?\nUser: No.\nAgent: Uhh... Alright. Take care. Goodbye.\n",
